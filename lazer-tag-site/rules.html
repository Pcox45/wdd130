          <h1>Game Modes</h1>
          <p>
        Room 1: We have a standard deathmatch game mode. Maximum players are 20.
        We have two teams that will battle for the highest score. Each person has
        3 lives, each elimination gives the entire team points. 3 Bonus points are
        given if you shoot the lights on the opponent's gun. The team with the
        most eliminations will win the game. Another way the team can secure
        victory is by eliminating the entire enemy team before the game ends in 15
        minutes.
      </p>
    </div>

<div class="container2p">
  <p>
    Room 2: We have captured the flag. Maximum players are 10. A player must
    carry the flag to their base. The flag is a virtual color code that can be
    captured when the player finds the opponent's console. The player must
    place his gun on the console which will change his gun to a different
    color. At that moment, the player must hurry back to his ally console and
    place his gun on the console to score 10 points. If he is eliminated the
    color code returns back to the console. The first team to 50 points wins
    the match. Players must guard the console and guard their teammates to
    win.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="container3p">
  <p>
    Room 3: Free for all. Maximum players are 15. Each person has 3 lives. A
    person is eliminated if the light tags on their body armor are shot. A
    player can receive 3 bonus points if they are able to shoot the light tags
    on an opponent's gun to eliminate them. Last man standing before 10
    minutes of the game ending wins or the person with the most points at the
    end wins.
